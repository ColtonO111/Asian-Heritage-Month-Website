Dr. Tam has been such a role mnodel and leader to the Canadian health community and people in general. During her 20 years in public health, she has provided technical expertise and leadership to improve communicable disease surveillance, enhance immunization programs, and strengthen health emergency management. Dr. Tam has has her priorities in check by making sure her focus on the impacts of the pandemic was on seniors, essential workers, and people living with disabilities which I respect a lot. Dr. Tam has a quote on COVID that I enjoy a lot because it describes her personallity and heart well,  “No one is protected until everyone is protected.”.
